	<tr> <th>Sea are one of the oldest creatures on earth that haven't changes for 110 million 
	years. They are air breathing reptiles, made for life in the sea. They are very large 
	and can grow up to 6 feet.They have very large flippers allowing them to go deep down and 
	swim far distances. Once male turtules are nested they go into the ocean and never return 
	to the shore again, unlike female turtles that return to lay their eggs. There are seven 
	diffeent types of sea turtles. They tend to resurface each hour to breathe, after being 
	submerged under water. The female turtles crawl ashore and dig to then lay about 100 eggs, 
	that are about the size of ping pong balls. </tr> </th>
