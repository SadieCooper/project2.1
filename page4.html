	<tr> <th>There are multiple ways we can stop these Sea Turtles from dying an being 
	endangered. One way is to stop using plastic. Instead of using a plastic water bottle, 
	maybe get a reusable one. Another way we can help is by participating in beach clean ups 
	so that you can help clean up things going in the ocean like trash, that the turtles can 
	get stuck in. The most simple way is by keeping the beach clean and picking up after 
	yourself before you leave the beach. </th>
