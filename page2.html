	The first problem is them being killed for their eggs, meat, skin and shells. The next
	problem is their enviroment being destroyed by us, the people. This is because of things 
	like plastic and fishing gear. The third problem is climate change, which effects their 
	nesting sites, causing the eggs to be affected.</th>
